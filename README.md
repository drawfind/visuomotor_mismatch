# Computational model of layer 2/3 in mouse primary visual cortex

The code in this repository accompanies the article "Computational model of layer 2/3 in mouse primary visual cortex explains observed visuomotor mismatch response."

To run the code for the main article, use the following command:
```bash
python mismatch_response_simulation1.py
```
Close a figure to see the next figure. This code produces five figures.

To run the code for the supplementary information, use the following command:
```bash
python mismatch_response_simulation2.py
```
Close a figure to see the next figure. This code produces two figures.
